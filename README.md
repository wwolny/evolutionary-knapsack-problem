# Evolutionary algorithms solving knapsack problem
Implementation of PBIL(Population-Based Incremental Learning) and greedy Ar evolutionary algorithms. PBIL is a genetic algorithm for which genotype of the whole population is a vector of probabilities for each element.

### Data
We have prepared three types of datasets based on the correlation between the weight of the item and it's cost. Three types are:
+ uncorrelated,
+ weakly correlated,
+ strongly correlated.
